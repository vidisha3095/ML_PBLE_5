XGBoost

The objective of this lab is to understand and apply the concepts of XGBoost (Extreme
Gradient Boosting), focusing on constructing and evaluating XGBoost models for both
classification and regression tasks. Students will learn to implement XGBoost using Python,
train the models on datasets, and evaluate their performance using various metrics such as
accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared. Also
compare the result with Random Forest.
